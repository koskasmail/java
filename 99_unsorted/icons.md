To add an icon to the line `01 Java Program.` in a Markdown file, you can use an emoji or a small image. Here are a few professional-looking options:

### ✅ Using Emoji
```md
📦 01 Java Program
```
Other emoji options:
- 💻 for general programming
- ☕ for Java (Java = coffee!)
- 🧩 for modular code
- 🗂️ for organized code

### 🖼️ Using Image Icon
If you prefer a small image icon (like a Java logo), use Markdown image syntax:
```md
![Java Icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg) 01 Java Program
```
Make sure the image URL is accessible and appropriately sized.

Would you like help choosing a specific icon for a theme (e.g., beginner, advanced, GUI, backend)?
