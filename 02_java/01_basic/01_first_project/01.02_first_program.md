# 01.02_first_program

## 01. package -

*  package or `package structure`
* `package structure` - is a file structure that organize different files in your program.
* `root` - top package structure (root) is usually a backward domain name.
* a package make the program code classified into different unit of code (subjects).
   * example: utilities, hr(human resource), sales, java_core, etc.

### package name as domanin name

```
 com.myDomain.utilities
```

* package name format: `lower-case`
  ( declare package name with lower case ).

* package name is a `subject` description name or business `description` topic.
   * example: utilities, hr(human resource), sales, etc.

* a `name` of the program file is
   * a combination of the `program name` and full package structure of the package is reside in.

#### `Summary`
* package `name`: 
   * backward domain name + program name -or- description topic name.
   * package name can be a subject description name -or- business description topic.

----------------------

# 02. java class

* Every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a `class`.
* `Statement` is a single line of code that performs a specific task.
* class name: description topic/subject name.
* class need to be focus in one subject.
* class name format: start with `Capital Letter` (Uppercase).
   * Example: HelloWorld, calculator, Etc.
* keep your class as small as possible to improve usability and readability.
* a class consist/contain of one or more `method`.

#### `Statement` inside `class`

```
package java_core;

public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
```

#### create a class:
   * class name will start with `Capital Letter`
      * "Example".
   * `{` - open curly branch -
      * define the beginning of the definition of the class 
   * `}` - closing curly branch -
      * define the end of the definition of the class
   * `{ code; }` -
      * write the code between the `{` -(open curly branch) -and- `}` -(closing curly branch).

##### output

```
Hello World
```

*  **Atten**
   * class need to be focus in one subject.
   * **Atten** -  keep your class as small as possible to improve usability and readability.
   * **Atten** a class consist/contain of one or more method.


#### Summary
* Every program in Java must have a `class`.
* Every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a `class`.
* `Statement` is a single line of code that performs a specific task.
* class name: description one topic/subject name.
* class name format: start with `Capital Letter` (Uppercase).
   * Example: HelloWorld, calculator, Etc.
* a class consist/contain of one or more `method`.
* Every program starts from the `main` method.

## 02 import -

### import 
* Every program file will reuse an exit code by `importing` that code in to your program files.
* `import package` will be declared beneath/under the package `declaration name`.
*  import class file name from a package

```
	// line 1 // package declaration name
  com.domain.myJava.example1.shop
    
  // line 2 // import class file name "parent" 
  import com.domain.myJava.example1.book.parent 
```
